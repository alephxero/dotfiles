* About

Basic emacs and zsh config.

* Emacs

Notable features of my configuration:
- Configuration is done through elisp named features
- Uses ~orderless~ and ~fido-vertical-mode~ for completions
- Uses ~eglot~ for lsp support along with ~treesit-auto~ to make it
  easier to install treesitter grammars

* Zsh

Notable features:
- Status indicator in prompt: teal for success and red for failure
- Two directory levels in prompt
- ~#~ prompt when root and ~>~ otherwise
- Up and Down arrows search through history for commands starting
  with the value in current line
